;; Arborist is a basic testing and assertion library for cedar in the cedar
;; standard library. It's very simple and allows for assertions at the very
;; least.
;; TODO: Add things like...
;;       'okay': check if the arg is truthy
;;       'fail': always fail
;;       'pass': always pass
;;

(import os)

(defn assert (x)
  (if x
    ;; x is truthy, return x))
    (return x)
    ;; otherwise, we need to panic and print out that the assertion failed
    (println "Assertion Failed")))
